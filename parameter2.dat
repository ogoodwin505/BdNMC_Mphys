#All masses should be provided in GeV, all lengths in meters.
#Lines preceded by a # are ignored by the parser.

#This is a second sample parameter card implements a more complicated run

#Give you run a name. If no name is supplied, one will be generated from the current time.

#Optionally, you may specify a number of pi0s per meson

#The simulation generates dark matter trajectories intersecting the detector, scatters them, and 
#throws away the results until burn_max is reached. If the number of attempts exceeds 
#burn_max*burn_timeout, the burn_in process aborts early and an alert is written to cerr
#before the simulation resumes.

#Choosing a production distribution is optional, but it must be grouped with the relevant production_channel entry
